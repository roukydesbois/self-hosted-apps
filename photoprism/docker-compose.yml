      ## Video Transcoding (https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/advanced/transcoding/):
      # PHOTOPRISM_FFMPEG_ENCODER: "software"        # H.264/AVC encoder (software, intel, nvidia, apple, raspberry, or vaapi)
      # PHOTOPRISM_FFMPEG_SIZE: "1920"               # video size limit in pixels (720-7680) (default: 3840)
      # PHOTOPRISM_FFMPEG_BITRATE: "32"              # video bitrate limit in Mbit/s (default: 50)
      ## Run/install on first startup (options: update, gpu, tensorflow, davfs, clean):
      # PHOTOPRISM_INIT: "update clean"
      ## Run as a non-root user after initialization (supported: 0, 33, 50-99, 500-600, and 900-1200):
      # PHOTOPRISM_UID: 1000
      # PHOTOPRISM_GID: 1000
      # PHOTOPRISM_UMASK: 0000
    ## Share hardware devices with FFmpeg and TensorFlow (optional):
    ## See: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html#driver-differences-when-using-libcamera-or-the-legacy-stack
    # devices:
    #  - "/dev/video11:/dev/video11" # Video4Linux Video Encode Device (h264_v4l2m2m)
    working_dir: "/photoprism" # do not change or remove
    ## Storage Folders: "~" is a shortcut for your home directory, "." for the current directory
    volumes:
      - "/data/originals:/photoprism/originals"               # Original media files (DO NOT REMOVE)
      - "/data/import:/photoprism/import"                  # *Optional* base folder from which files can be imported to originals
      - "/data/storage:/photoprism/storage"                  # *Writable* storage folder for cache, database, and sidecar files (DO NOT REMOVE)

  ## MariaDB Database Server (recommended)
  ## see https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/faq/#should-i-use-sqlite-mariadb-or-mysql
  mariadb:
    image: arm64v8/mariadb:11 # ARM64 IMAGE ONLY, DOES NOT WORK ON ARMv7, AMD or Intel
    platform: "linux/arm64"
    ## If MariaDB gets stuck in a restart loop, this points to a memory or filesystem issue:
    ## https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/#fatal-server-errors
    restart: unless-stopped

    ## Never store database files on an unreliable device such as a USB flash drive, an SD card, or a shared network folder:
